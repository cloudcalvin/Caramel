# 5.13 Test sur des programmes complexes

Complex programs have too long assembly code to be showed here.
Here are some complex programs we wrote:
 * [Ackermann](../tests/programs/ackermann.c)
 * [display number](../tests/programs/displayNumber.c)
 * [Factorial](../tests/programs/factorial.c)
 * [Fibonacci](../tests/programs/fibonacci.c)
 * [Syracuse](../tests/programs/syracuse.c)
 * [quicksort](../tests/programs/quicksort.c)

Here is how to execute a test (eg. fibonacci.c), and see the generated assembly:
```bash
./chef.py test backend -bw tests/programs/fibonacci.c
cat build/cpp-bin/assembly.s
```
